## Implementations (Author: Rohit Jain)

`python` `numpy` `matplotlib` `jupyter`

> HTML output of jupyter notebooks for my implementattion of the year 2019 version of CS231n is avaibable [here]() for quick reference.
>
> Implementation was done with the following setup, various execution times in the output are from this setup:
>
> - *Processor* - Intel Core 2 Duo CPU P8600 @2.40 GHz
> - *RAM* - 4 GB
> - *OS* - Windows 7
>
>
> Code for my implementations is not posted on this public repository.
